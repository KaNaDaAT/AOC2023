## About the Solutions

### AOCSetup

For a seamless start each year, I provide a default project setup that comes with a user interface and console application for running Advent of Code challenges. Currently, the setup is tailored for C#, but it's under development, and support for other languages may be added in the future. Additionally, the setup includes a library with handy helper functions to streamline the coding process.

Feel free to explore the [AOCSetup](https://github.com/KaNaDaAT/AOCSetup) repository for more details and set up your environment for a smooth Advent of Code experience.

### Language

The solutions in this repository are for now primarily implemented in C#. The project setup aims to facilitate an efficient workflow for solving challenges.

### LINQ Heavy

My solutions tends to be very LINQ (Language-Integrated Query). LINQ provides a powerful way to query and manipulate data in C#, making the code more concise and expressive.

It might not always follow best practices nor be most effiecient. I am just trying to have some very short LINQ code most of the time.
